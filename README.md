# This dataset consists of two different exam scores along with the admission score for each exam. Here, we have tried to analyze how Exam 1 and Exam 2 affect admission score. We have used gradient descent and linear regression. We have computed regression performance metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ². Correlation analysis is carried out to see which exam is more correlated with the admission score numerically and visually.
